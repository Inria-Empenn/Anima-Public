ANIMA: Source Code Repository
-----

ANIMA has been created as the new place to hold the softwares from Empenn. Mainly based on ITK and VTK, it has been designed to hold C++ source code in a modular structure. People in the team are encouraged to contribute their algorithms here so that others may benefit from it easily.
